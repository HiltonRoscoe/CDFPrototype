These example show how to use the NIST CVR Common Data Format (CDF) to represent various voting scenarios.

## Assumptions

- This document uses the ballot semantics model built by the Election Modeling Working Group.

## Anatomy of a CVR

> This section uses [Example 2](xml/example_2.xml)

The CDF specification permits a wide range of data to be stored in a CVR, ranging from minimal information about the voted contests and contest selections to expanded information about all contests on the ballot as well as other items. This section explains the construction of a minimal 1500-103 instance, containing only the voted contests and candidates that were selected by the voter. It contains two CVRs, each indicating a selection for a candidate in a contest. Each CVR also references an image of the corresponding scanned ballot.

> A 1500-103 instance (i.e. XML or JSON) may contain one or more `CVRs`, which in turn must contain one or more `CVRSnapshots`, each representing a CVR at specific point in time.

The file is divided roughly into two parts: the CVR elements at the beginning followed by other elements for defining the election and its contests, candidates, and contest selections so that the CVR elements can link to them as necessary. [Lines 188-227](https://github.com/HiltonRoscoe/CDFPrototype/blob/902f72bdc1399f9b6a8164ac85e75be0d14d4588/CVR/xml/example_2.xml#L188-L227) describes an election containing the contest, candidate, and contest selection definitions.

 The CVR elements link to these items by using identifiers defined in the contest, candidate, and contest selection's `ObjectId` attributes. For example, the contest definition [starting on line 211](https://github.com/HiltonRoscoe/CDFPrototype/blob/902f72bdc1399f9b6a8164ac85e75be0d14d4588/CVR/xml/example_2.xml#L211-L225) contains:

```xml
<Contest ObjectId="_C1" xsi:type="CandidateContest">
```

so that CVR elements can link to this contest definition by using the `ObjectId` `_C1`.  

> Note that the object identifiers are not the same as the codes that a jurisdiction may use to identify contests or candidates. The object identifiers are entirely unique to a CVR report; the exporting application must add them as it builds the report file. These identifiers are used only as a means for linking contest, contest selections, etc., together within the report file.

[Lines 3-44](https://github.com/HiltonRoscoe/CDFPrototype/blob/902f72bdc1399f9b6a8164ac85e75be0d14d4588/CVR/xml/example_2.xml#L3-L44) contain the CVR elements. Each `CVR` element includes at least one `CVRSnapshot`.

> Each `CVRSnapshot` represents a particular `Type`, such as the `original`  captured from a scanner, after it has been `interpreted` (i.e. business rules have been applied), or otherwise `modified`.

`CVRSnapshot` element includes one or more `CVRContest`, which links to the voted contest whose object identifier is `_C1`, thereby uniquely identifying that contest within the report file. It then includes `CVRContestSelection`, which links to a contest option that was selected by the voter.  Each `CVR` element also includes an optional sequence number; this isnâ€™t required but could be helpful to auditors.

## Basic Example

> This section uses [Example 1](xml/example_1.xml)

Consider the following contest:

**For Treasurer of State**

- [x] Connie Pillich
- [ ] Josh Mandel

can be represented with the following XML fragment:

```xml
<cdf:CVRContest>
    <cdf:ContestId>_5TS</cdf:ContestId>
    <cdf:CVRContestSelection>
        <cdf:ContestSelectionId>_1ECP</cdf:ContestSelectionId>
        <cdf:Position>1</cdf:Position>
        <cdf:SelectionIndication>
            <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
            <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
        </cdf:SelectionIndication>
    </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
    <cdf:Undervotes>0</cdf:Undervotes>
</cdf:CVRContest>
```

The `cdf:ContestSelectionId` value of `_1ECP` represents the reference to the selected contest option:

```xml
<cdf:Candidate ObjectId="_1ECP">
    ...
    <cdf:Name>Connie Pillich</cdf:Name>
    ...
</cdf:Candidate>
```

By doing the same for `_5TS`, we can see this does indeed represent a contest selection of **Connie Pillich** for **Treasurer of State**.

```xml
<cdf:Contest xsi:type="cdf:CandidateContest" ObjectId="_5TS">
    ...
    <cdf:Name>For Treasurer of State</cdf:Name>
    <cdf:VoteVariation>n-of-m</cdf:VoteVariation>
    <cdf:VotesAllowed>1</cdf:VotesAllowed>
</cdf:Contest>
```

> Note that the object identifiers (`ObjectId`) are not the same as the codes that a jurisdiction may use to identify contests or candidates. The object identifiers are entirely unique to a CVR report; the exporting application must add them as it builds the report file. These identifiers should only be used to link contest, contest selections, etc., together within the report file.

`SelectionIndication` may appear to be superfluous, don't we already know the outcome for this contest? As we'll find this element will come in handy.

> For a contest selection that is not a write-in, `SelectionIndication` is always required.

## SelectionIndication

`SelectionIndication` is used to convey those selections that are potentially allocable to a contest option. Indications can come from the following sources:

- A `Mark` made by the voter on a paper ballot
- A `Mark` made by a marking device onto a full face paper ballot
- An indication made by machine as a result applying business rules
- An indication made by an adjudicator

### Voter Made `Marks` (Paper Only)

`SelectionIndication` has a subtype, `Mark`, which should be used whenever a mark is placed upon a *contest option position* of a full face paper ballot.

```xml
<cdf:SelectionIndication xsi:type="Mark">
    <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
    <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
</cdf:SelectionIndication>
```

#### Mark Metrics

A `Mark` may be associated with one or more `MarkMetric`, which is a implementation dependent measure of an mark.

For example:

```xml
<cdf:MarkMetric>
    <cdf:Type>AJAX</cdf:Type>
    <cdf:Value>98</cdf:Value>
</cdf:MarkMetric>
```

The mark has a quality measurement of type AJAX (a fictional quality measurement) and quality score of 98 (0 is the worst, 100 is the best).

### Machine Generated Indications

If an indication was generated by machine, such as in the case of straight party voting, then use `SelectionIndication` directly.

```xml
<cdf:SelectionIndication>
    <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
    <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
    <cdf:Status>generated-rules</cdf:Status>
</cdf:SelectionIndication>
```

### Adjudication

> This section only applies to adjudication done electronically.

If a mark was present, but was not captured in the initial CVR, then it should be indicated as a `Mark` with the `Status` element set to `adjudicated`.

```xml
<cdf:SelectionIndication xsi:type="Mark">
    <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
    <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
    <cdf:Status>adjudicated</cdf:Status>
</cdf:SelectionIndication>
```

> `Mark` should be used to capture marks that are *machine readable* only. This usually means marks that fall within the *contest option position*. Marks that convey voter intent but fall outside the target area should be handled as `SelectionIndications`.

Conversely, if a `Mark` is determined to not be a selection for a given contest option, then set `IsAllocable` to `false`.

### Handling of Marks

Marks should be treated as indelible. They can be added, but never removed from a CVR instance.`Marks` are **not** shorthand for votes (see [Tabulation Logic](#tabulationlogic))

### Meaning of `IsAllocable`

As we mentioned above, marks are indelible, so we cannot just omit marks as shorthand for a mark not indicating a contest selection (i.e. after adjudication). This is where `IsAllocable` comes in. `IsAllocable` tells us whether the indication (and the associated number of votes) should be allocated to the contest option's accumulator (counter).

> Previous drafts of the spec used a complex set of statuses that the consumer was required to interpret. By using a single flag, we know if the mark counts, and the statuses can tell us why.

> The value of `IsAllocable` should singularly determine if `NumberVotes` will be allocated a contest option's accumulator.

## Handling Overvotes

> This section only applies to paper ballots.

Consider the following contest:

**For Treasurer of State**

- [x] Connie Pillich
- [x] Josh Mandel

Can be represented with the XML below:

```xml
<cdf:CVRContest>
    <cdf:ContestId>_5TS</cdf:ContestId>
    <cdf:CVRContestSelection xsi:type="Mark">
        <cdf:ContestSelectionId>_1ECP</cdf:ContestSelectionId>
        <cdf:Position>1</cdf:Position>
        <cdf:SelectionIndication>
            <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
            <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
        </cdf:SelectionIndication>
    </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
    <cdf:CVRContestSelection>
        <cdf:ContestSelectionId>_1EJM</cdf:ContestSelectionId>
        <cdf:Position>2</cdf:Position>
        <cdf:SelectionIndication xsi:type="Mark">
            <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
            <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
        </cdf:SelectionIndication>
    </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
    <cdf:Undervotes>0</cdf:Undervotes>
</cdf:CVRContest>
```

Note that the marks are still accounted for, even though the votes will not be allocated to the contest option accumulators for Connie Pillich nor John Mandel, but instead to the overvote accumulator.



> If the CVR producer wants a downstream processor to adjudicate the selection indications, it should set `IsAllocable` to `unknown`.

## Write-Ins

### Basic Write-In

Consider the following contest:

**Governor**

- [ ] Edward FitzGerald
- [ ] John Kasich
- [ ] Anita Rios
- [x] Write-In (John Smith)

can be represented with the following xml fragment:

```xml
<cdf:CVRContest>
    <cdf:ContestId>_1GO</cdf:ContestId>
    <cdf:CVRContestSelection xsi:type="cdf:CVRWriteIn">
        <cdf:Position>4</cdf:Position>
        <cdf:SelectionIndication>
            <cdf:IsAllocable>unknown</cdf:IsAllocable>
            <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
        </cdf:SelectionIndication>
        <cdf:Status>needs-adjudication</cdf:Status>
        <cdf:Text>John Smith</cdf:Text>
    </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
    <cdf:Undervotes>0</cdf:Undervotes>
</cdf:CVRContest>
```

### Explanation

Note that this fragment is from an originating device, such that we do not yet know the validity of the write-in. Still we can say some things about it.

The text of the write-in is `John Smith`. This is represented using the `cdf:Text` element.

> Note that the `cdf:SelectionIndication` represents both the selection of the *write-in contest option* *and* the write-in itself. Thus it is not possible to say that the selection of the write-in option is valid, but the write-in name provided is not.

### Adjudication of Write-Ins

Adjudication can do two things

1. Determine if the name represents a valid contest selection. I.e. does the write-in text represent a valid write-in option?

2. Determine if the contest selection should be allocated. This is different from (1), as even if it is determined that the write-in text represents a valid write-in option, it may be overwritten by interpretation of voter intent.

## CVR Snapshots

The CVR can be used throughout various points in the election lifecycle:

- Capture of contest selections
- Interpretation of contest selections
- Adjudication of contest selections
- Others

If a downstream system needs to modify the CVR, such as to add a `CVRContestSelection` as the result of adjudication, a new CVRSnapshot should be created.

Consider the following XML fragment:

```xml
<cdf:CVRSnapshot>
    <cdf:CVRContest>
        <cdf:ContestId>_6RC</cdf:ContestId>
        <cdf:CVRContestSelection>
            <cdf:ContestSelectionId>_1FMZ</cdf:ContestSelectionId>
            <cdf:Position>1</cdf:Position>
            <cdf:SelectionIndication xsi:type="cdf:Mark">
                <cdf:IsAllocable>unknown</cdf:IsAllocable>
                <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
                <cdf:MarkMetric>
                    <cdf:Type>AJAX</cdf:Type>
                    <cdf:Value>70</cdf:Value>
                </cdf:MarkMetric>
            </cdf:SelectionIndication>
        </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
        <cdf:Undervotes>0</cdf:Undervotes>
    </cdf:CVRContest>
    <cdf:IsCurrent>false</cdf:IsCurrent>
    <cdf:Status>needs-adjudication</cdf:Status>
    <cdf:Type>original</cdf:Type>
</cdf:CVRSnapshot>
```

This represents a CVR having a single voted contest, in which the allocation of the indication is `unknown` (e.g. the mark is marginal). The `Status` of the `CVRSnapshot` is `needs-adjudication` so as to flag a downstream system.

An adjudicator takes a look at the mark, and determines that it does not convey voter intent to make a selection for `Mark Zetzer`, `IsAllocable` is set to `false`, and a new `CVRSnapshot` is created recording this action:

```xml
<cdf:CVRSnapshot>
    <cdf:Annotation>
        <cdf:AdjudicatorName>Mark Kennamond</cdf:AdjudicatorName>
        <cdf:Message>Resting Mark, Mark Zetzer</cdf:Message>
        <cdf:TimeStamp>2018-05-16T12:10:09</cdf:TimeStamp>
    </cdf:Annotation>
    <cdf:CVRContest>
        <cdf:ContestId>_6RC</cdf:ContestId>
        <cdf:CVRContestSelection>
            <cdf:ContestSelectionId>_1FMZ</cdf:ContestSelectionId>
            <cdf:Position>1</cdf:Position>
            <cdf:SelectionIndication xsi:type="cdf:Mark">
                <cdf:IsAllocable>no</cdf:IsAllocable>
                <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
                <cdf:MarkMetric>
                    <cdf:Type>AJAX</cdf:Type>
                    <cdf:Value>70</cdf:Value>
                </cdf:MarkMetric>
            </cdf:SelectionIndication>
        </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
        <cdf:Undervotes>1</cdf:Undervotes>
    </cdf:CVRContest>
    <cdf:IsCurrent>true</cdf:IsCurrent>
    <cdf:Type>interpreted</cdf:Type>
</cdf:CVRSnapshot>
```

(ADD STUFF ABOUT ADJUDICATOR)

The `CVR` may contain as many `CVRSnapshots` as required, but only one should be marked as the current tabulable record (`IsCurrent` set to `true`).


## Secondary Information

### Ballot Images

If a scanner is capable of capturing raster ballot images, then this data can be stored alongside the structured CVR.

Ballot images can either be referenced from the CVR as a URI, or stored within it, as `base64` encoded binary.

#### Storing a reference

```xml
<BallotImage>
    <Location>http://192.168.1.1/imageserver/ballot1056.jpeg</Location>
</BallotImage>
```

#### Storing Image Data
```xml
    <BallotImage>
            <Image FileName="CVR1_Ballot.jpg" MimeType="image/jpeg"/>
        </BallotImage>
```

## Voting Method Support

The NIST CVR CDF supports all major voting methods currently in use in the United States. 

### Rank Choice Voting

Consider the following contest:

**Member of County Council at Large**

|Contest Option|1st  |2nd  |3rd  |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|
|Ilene Shapiro | [ ] | [x] | [ ] |
|Debbie Walsh  | [x] | [ ] | [ ] |
|Sandra Kurt   | [ ] | [ ] | [x] |

```xml
<cdf:CVRContest>
    <cdf:ContestId>_9CC</cdf:ContestId>
    <cdf:CVRContestSelection>
        <cdf:ContestSelectionId>_1HIS</cdf:ContestSelectionId>
        <cdf:Position>2</cdf:Position>
        <cdf:SelectionIndication>
            <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
            <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
            <cdf:Rank>2</cdf:Rank>
        </cdf:SelectionIndication>
        <cdf:TotalNumberVotes>1</cdf:TotalNumberVotes>
    </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
    <cdf:CVRContestSelection>
        <cdf:ContestSelectionId>_1HDW</cdf:ContestSelectionId>
        <cdf:Position>3</cdf:Position>
        <cdf:SelectionIndication>
            <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
            <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
            <cdf:Rank>1</cdf:Rank>
        </cdf:SelectionIndication>
        <cdf:TotalNumberVotes>1</cdf:TotalNumberVotes>
    </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
    <cdf:CVRContestSelection>
        <cdf:ContestSelectionId>_1HSK</cdf:ContestSelectionId>
        <cdf:Position>6</cdf:Position>
        <cdf:SelectionIndication>
            <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
            <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
            <cdf:Rank>3</cdf:Rank>
        </cdf:SelectionIndication>
        <cdf:TotalNumberVotes>1</cdf:TotalNumberVotes>
    </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
    <cdf:Undervotes>0</cdf:Undervotes>
</cdf:CVRContest>
```

Each candidate may be ranked using the `Rank` attribute. The rank may or may not be the same as the `Position`.

## Cumulative Voting

Consider the following contest:

**Member of County Council at Large**

|Contest Option|1st  |2nd  |3rd  |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|
|Ilene Shapiro | [ ] | [x] | [ ] |
|Debbie Walsh  | [x] | [ ] | [x] |
|Sandra Kurt   | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

If the ballot was hand marked, then the following CVR could be constructed:

```xml
<cdf:CVRContest>
    <cdf:ContestId>_9CC</cdf:ContestId>
    <cdf:CVRContestSelection>
        <cdf:ContestSelectionId>_1HIS</cdf:ContestSelectionId>
        <cdf:Position>2</cdf:Position>
        <cdf:SelectionIndication xsi:type="Mark">
            <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
            <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
            <cdf:Position>2</cdf:Position>
        </cdf:SelectionIndication>
        <cdf:TotalNumberVotes>1</cdf:TotalNumberVotes>
    </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
    <cdf:CVRContestSelection>
        <cdf:ContestSelectionId>_1HDW</cdf:ContestSelectionId>
        <cdf:Position>3</cdf:Position>
        <cdf:SelectionIndication xsi:type="Mark">
            <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
            <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
            <cdf:Position>1</cdf:Position>
        </cdf:SelectionIndication>
        <cdf:SelectionIndication xsi:type="Mark">
            <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
            <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>
            <cdf:Position>3</cdf:Position>
        </cdf:SelectionIndication>
        <cdf:TotalNumberVotes>1</cdf:TotalNumberVotes>
    </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
    <cdf:Undervotes>0</cdf:Undervotes>
</cdf:CVRContest>
```

Because **Debbie Walsh** received two votes, she has two `SelectionIndications`.

If the same vote was cast on a ballot marking device, the CVR could be simplified somewhat:

```xml
<cdf:CVRContest>
    <cdf:ContestId>_9CC</cdf:ContestId>
    <cdf:CVRContestSelection>
        <cdf:ContestSelectionId>_1HIS</cdf:ContestSelectionId>
        <cdf:Position>2</cdf:Position>
        <cdf:SelectionIndication>
            <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
            <cdf:NumberVotes>1</cdf:NumberVotes>  
        </cdf:SelectionIndication>
        <cdf:TotalNumberVotes>1</cdf:TotalNumberVotes>
    </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
    <cdf:CVRContestSelection>
        <cdf:ContestSelectionId>_1HDW</cdf:ContestSelectionId>
        <cdf:Position>3</cdf:Position>
        <cdf:SelectionIndication>
            <cdf:IsAllocable>yes</cdf:IsAllocable>
            <cdf:NumberVotes>2</cdf:NumberVotes>
        </cdf:SelectionIndication>
        <cdf:TotalNumberVotes>1</cdf:TotalNumberVotes>
    </cdf:CVRContestSelection>
    <cdf:Undervotes>0</cdf:Undervotes>
</cdf:CVRContest>
```

The representation of the indication for **Ilene Shapiro** is unchanged, but Debbie Walsh's votes have been consolidating into a single `SelectionIndication`, with a `NumberVotes` of `2`.
